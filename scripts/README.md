# SIMPLE Scripts

This directory contains scripts which have been used to modify the SIMPLE database. 
They are "one-off" scripts which are not intended to be re-used, but rather to record the changes that have been made. 
They also provide examples for how ingests can be done.

The folders are organized as follows:

- `ingests/`
  - Scripts to handle ingest of new data into the database
- `updates/`
	- scripts which update large chunks of data in the database 	
- `spectra_convert/`
  - Scripts which convert spectra files
